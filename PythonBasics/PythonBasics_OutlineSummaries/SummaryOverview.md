## Summary: Integers, Floats, Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples
### In this section you learned that:

- Integers are for representing whole numbers:
> rank = 10
>
> eggs = 12
>
> people = 3
>

- Floatsrepresent continuous values:
> temperature = 10.2
>
> rainfall = 5.98
>
> elevation = 1031.88

- Stringsrepresent any text:
> message = "Welcome to our online shop!"
>
> name = "John"
>
> serial = "R001991981SW"

- Listsrepresent arrays of values that may change during the course of the program:
> members = ["Sim Soony", "Marry Roundknee", "Jack Corridor"]
> pixel_values = [252, 251, 251, 253, 250, 248, 247]

- Dictionariesrepresent pairs of keys and values:
> phone_numbers = {"John Smith": "+37682929928", "Marry Simpons": "+423998200919"}
>
> volcano_elevations = {"Glacier Peak": 3213.9, "Rainer": 4392.1}

- Keysof a dictionary can be extracted with:
> phone_numbers.keys()

- Valuesof a dictionary can be extracted with:
> phone_numbers.values()

- Tuplesrepresent arrays of values that are not to be changed during the course of the program:
> vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
> one_digits = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

- To find out what attributesa type has:
> dir(str)
> dir(list)
> dir(dict)

- To find out what Python builtin functionsthere are:
> dir(__builtins__)

- Documentationfor a Python command can be found with:
> help(str)
> help(str.replace)
> help(dict.values)
